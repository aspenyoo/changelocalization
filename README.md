# The role of uncertainty in change localization

This project was somewhat related to the aspenyoo/changedetection repo, because it also aimed to answer whether people could use unceratinty information in a WM task. 

The results of this project had unclear conclusions. Models were theoretically distinguishable for realistic parameter combinations (i.e., successful model recovery), but the results of model comparison were inconclusive for actual subject data (the winning model was different for different subjects)

Would the results be more clear with a different experimental paradigm? Is this task "cognitive" enough that participants could be heterogeneous? These are interesting questions that could be answered with more futzing around and by running more subjects, but questions we we didn't think were worth the effort. 

If you find yourself here because you are interested in this question, do not hesitate to contact me or my collaborators! We'd be happy to help however we can. 


### Goal
The goal of this project was to investigate whether people used item-to-item knowledge of memory uncertainty when making decisions about if a stimulus changed orientations over a brief delay. Previous research has demonstrated that humans can maintain uncertainty information over a brief delay (XX). Other research has demonstrated that, when uncertainty information is available, people are able to use it when making decisions (XX). However, people have not shown the conjunction. 

### Experiment
- trial sequence
- number of trials etc

### models
- derivation/description of models

### Results
- main effects/manipulation results
- model comparison

### File descriptions
There are three main folders in this repo, experiment_data, analysis, and scripts. Each of these folders has a readme file containing descriptions of their files. 

- **experiment_data**: scripts used to run experiments. analyzable data
- **analysis**: anything related to analyzing/modeling the data. 
- **scripts**: scripts to fit models on HPC.
